# Search Strategy - Targeted Queries for Official Sources

This document provides optimized search queries to efficiently locate official scholarship information.

## General Principles

1. **Always use `site:` operator** to restrict to official university domains
2. **Use exact scholarship name in quotes** when known
3. **Combine multiple terms** to narrow results
4. **Try variations** of terminology (UK vs US English)

## Search Efficiency Tips

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with university domain + "scholarship international"
2. **Use OR operator**: `site:uni.edu (undergraduate OR bachelor) scholarship`
3. **Exclude irrelevant**: `site:uni.edu scholarship -graduate -masters -phd`
4. **Check cached versions**: If page is down, use Google cache
5. **Try Wayback Machine**: For historical deadline information
6. **Check PDF documents**: Many detailed requirements are in PDFs

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't trust aggregator details** - always verify on official source
2. **Watch for outdated information** - check page dates
3. **Distinguish scholarship vs admission requirements** - they may differ
4. **Check all tabs/sections** - requirements may be split across pages
5. **Look for footnotes/asterisks** - conditions often hidden there
