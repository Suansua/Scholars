# Filtering Logic - Courtroom Standard Criteria

This document defines the strict pass/fail criteria for scholarship evaluation. Each criterion requires official source evidence with exact quotes.

## Overview

All 10 criteria (C1-C10) must PASS for a scholarship to be shortlisted. Scholarships failing exactly one criterion are classified as "near-misses." Those failing 2+ criteria or missing proof are rejected.
