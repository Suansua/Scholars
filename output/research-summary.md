# Research Summary and Recommendations

> **Date**: 2025-12-26  
> **Applicant Profile**: Zimbabwean student, ZIMSEC O-level + Cambridge A-level, STEM/EE focus  
> **Target**: 2026 undergraduate intake  
> **Status**: PRELIMINARY - REQUIRES LIVE VERIFICATION

## Executive Summary

After analyzing 20 scholarship leads against the strict C1-C10 criteria, the findings are:

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Shortlist (Pending Verification)** | 3 | All require live website verification |
| **Near Misses** | 8 | Fail exactly one criterion |
| **Rejected** | 9 | Fail 2+ criteria or wrong level |

### Key Finding
The strict criteria combination (full ride + undergraduate + Zimbabwe + no SAT + no IELTS/waiver + deadline after 2026-01-15) significantly limits options. However, **relaxing just the IELTS requirement would add 4+ high-quality scholarships**.

## Shortlist (Pending Verification)

### Tier 1: Strongest Candidates

| Rank | Scholarship | Why Strong | Key Verification Needed |
|------|-------------|------------|------------------------|

| 2 | **Reach Oxford** | Top UK university; no SAT; financial need focus | IELTS waiver for A-levels |
| 3 | **ALU Scholarship** | Pan-African; no SAT; own assessment | EE program; full funding details |

### Recommended Priority Order
1. **Mastercard Foundation** - Apply to multiple test-optional partners
2. **Reach Oxford** - High prestige, but competitive
3. **ALU** - Good backup if EE program available
