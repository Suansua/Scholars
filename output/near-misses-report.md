## Research Status

This report is pending the completion of the research workflow:

1. ☐ Lead generation completed
2. ☐ Longlist created from leads  
3. ☐ Official proof collection for each lead
4. ☐ Criterion scoring (C1-C10)
5. ☐ Near-miss identification (exactly 1 fail)
6. ☐ Near-miss analysis and recommendations

## Expected Near-Miss Categories

Based on the strict criteria, likely near-miss patterns include:

### C8 Failures (SAT Required)
Many quality scholarships require SAT scores. These would be near-misses if all other criteria pass.

### C9 Failures (IELTS/TOEFL Required, No Waiver)
English proficiency tests are common requirements. Scholarships without clear waiver routes for English-medium education would fail here.

### C7 Failures (Deadline Issues)
Scholarships with deadlines before 2026-01-15 or without announced 2026 dates.

### C3/C4/C5 Failures (Incomplete Funding)
Scholarships that cover tuition but not accommodation or stipend.

## Criterion Relaxation Analysis

If the applicant must relax exactly one criterion:

| Relaxed Criterion | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| C8 (Allow SAT required) | Must take SAT exam | Consider if scholarship value justifies SAT prep |
| C9 (Allow IELTS required) | Must take IELTS exam | IELTS is widely available and valid for 2 years |
| C5 (Allow no stipend) | Need alternative living funds | Only if family can support living costs |
| C4 (Allow no housing) | Need alternative housing | Only if off-campus housing is affordable |

## Instructions

To populate this report:

1. Complete scholarship research using [`docs/research-workflow.md`](../docs/research-workflow.md)
2. Identify scholarships with exactly one failing criterion
3. Document the specific failure reason and evidence

## Notes

Near-misses are valuable because:
- Policies may change before 2026 application deadlines
- Applicant may choose to relax one criterion if benefits outweigh costs
- Some failures may have workarounds not initially discovered
